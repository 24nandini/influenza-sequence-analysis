# influenza-sequence-analysis

## overview
My project analyses influenza protein sequences across multiple virus proteins of Inflenza A to compare amino acid composition, conserved and variable regions, and mutation frequency patterns.

## Data
- Protein sequences retrieved from public databases
- Multiple influenza serotypes analyzed
- Multiple sequence alignment performed

## Methods
- Amino acid frequency analysis
- Conservation and variability analysis
- Mutation frequency analysis

## Results
The analysis highlights differences in amino acid usage, conserved v/s variable positions, and protein-specific mutation hotspots.
